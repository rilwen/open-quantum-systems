This is a C++ code for modelling open quantum systems, accompanying my paper 

A. M. Werpachowska, "Reduced operator approximation for modelling open quantum systems", http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.1753

It includes the Reduced Operator Approximation, Quantum State Diffusion and Pseudomode methods, algorithms for modelling quantum systems with static noise, as well as some general numerical methods.

Requirements:
- C++ 11 compiler (I recommend g++ 4.8.x)
- Eigen 3.x library
- GNU Scientific Library library
- FFTW 3.x library
- SCons build system
- google-test library (for unit tests)
