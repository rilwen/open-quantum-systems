open-quantum-systems
====================

This is a C++ code for modelling open quantum systems, accompanying the paper 

A. M. Werpachowska, "Reduced operator approximation for modelling open quantum systems", http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.1753

It includes the Reduced Operator Approximation, Quantum State Diffusion and Pseudomode methods, algorithms for modelling quantum systems with static noise, as well as some general numerical methods.

Requirements:
- C++ 11 compiler
- Eigen library
- GSL library
- FFTW library
- SCons build system
